    And the following "users" exist:
      | username | firstname |
      | teacher  | Teacher   |

  Scenario: Import and export Opaque questions
    # Import sample file.
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question import" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I upload "question/type/opaque/tests/fixtures/testquestion.moodle.xml" file to "Import" filemanager
    And I press "id_submitbutton"
    Then I should see "Parsing questions from import file."
    And I should see "Importing 1 questions from file"
    When I press "Continue"
    Then I should see "Imported Opaque question"

    # Now export again.
    When I am on the "Course 1" "core_question > course question export" page logged in as teacher
    And I set the field "id_format_xml" to "1"
    And I set the field "category" to "Imported questions (1)"
    And I press "Export questions to file"
    Then following "click here" should download between "950" and "1250" bytes

    # Verify that the engine definition was imported.
    When I log out
    And I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Plugins > Question types > Opaque" in site administration
    Then I should see "Test OpenMark engine (Used by 1 questions)"
